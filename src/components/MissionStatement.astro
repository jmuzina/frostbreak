            Welcome. Come in out of the snow, weâ€™ve been waiting for you.<br>
            Frostbreak is a queer-focused community, a gathering place, a shelter from the storm based around
            Buffalo, NY.
            A place to connect and support one another, and help for those who need it.
            A warm reminder that although it feels very isolating, you are not alone.<br>
            <strong>We are stronger together.</strong>
